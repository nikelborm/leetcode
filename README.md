# LeetCode

## What's this?

This is the result of me and my friends attempting to solve leetcode for a month. Let's say it honestly, we failed. I probably did more then them, but it doesn't matter, because I'm no different: I didn't do even remotely the amount I promised. Leetcode grind is not fun. It's fucking boring. What was actually fun is writing fucking integration into google spreadsheets with `Google Action Script`. You can see the script in `./spreadsheet.gs`. What was also fun is learning how interactive VS Code task work [here](https://github.com/nikelborm/leetcode/blob/d3046d84ea72a07bc11a64f829adbf9ba825203b/.vscode/tasks.json#L9). It automatically calculates personalized deadlines for everybody. You can see it in action [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uIC97XSDDYYB9bAaHBWc6t1iZgGo5C19fEP693ugxZU/edit?gid=0#gid=0).
